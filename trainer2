Hi Saad Obaid,

Besides that I've got some special Christmas offers you can read all about below.

Happy holidays!

** Christmas Offer: FREE Violin and Viola Fingerboard Map with the purchase of a Zlata carbon fiber violin or viola bow in december '16.
------------------------------------------------------------

http://violinlounge.com/carbon-bows/

With my years long experience in selecting bows and helping players find there ideal bow, I introduce my own line of Zlata carbon fiber bows. These bows are specially made for me and exclusively available at Violin Lounge.

Our bows have a large percentage of carbon. Cheap carbon bows consist of only 25% carbon and for the rest they consist of glue and plastic. The higher the carbon percentage of a bow, the better the bow sounds and plays. Our bows have 60% carbon.

Each individual bow is checked by a luthier after production.

Do you want to learn to play one of the most beautiful violin solo's in the world? I've made 3 extensive instruction videos on how to learn Meditation from Tha\xc3\xafs by Massenet combined with sheet music with my notes.

I've taught this piece to many students, have performed it a lot myself en know exactly how to overcome the technical difficulties and how to perform it in a way that moves peoples to tears (in a good way!).

These videos are just a tiny part of the enormous amount of courses and hundreds and hundreds of video lessons you get when you enroll as my online violin student in the Violin Lounge Academy. It's just $ 20 a month and that's an absolute steal!

Beyond Silicon: Squeezing More Out of Chips
The New York Times (10/30/16) John Markoff

The need to explore alternative computing methods is gaining urgency as the end of Moore\'s Law looms and silicon semiconductors reach their physical limits.  The answer may lie with better algorithms and new hardware circuits that boost chip performance at a lower cost.  "Today, you\'re entering this patchwork world where you are going to find a better solution for a particular problem, and that\'s how we\'re going to advance in the future," says Georgia Institute of Technology professor Thomas M. Conte.  Earlier this month, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and two universities demonstrated a programming technique for an Intel microprocessor that uses less power to execute the same work.  They deactivated half of the chip\'s circuitry committed to mathematical precision, and then "reinvested" the savings to enhance the quality of the computed outcome.  Supercomputer designers say this is a significant achievement because the high-energy needs of the fastest computers have become especially challenging as researchers attempt a transition from petaflop computers to exaflop systems.  The Argonne researchers are probing the concept of trading off precision to realize dramatic computing efficiency improvements.  Rice University professor Krishna V. Palem says his team plans to broaden the Argonne research to run climate change-related models more efficiently.
